# Turkish Speech-to-Text and Summarization Web Application

This project is a web application that transcribes Turkish audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, M4A) uploaded by users into text and then summarizes this text using Google Gemini.

## Features

- **Audio File Upload:** Accepts audio files in various formats.
- **Speech Recognition (Vosk):** Uses the Vosk library to transcribe uploaded audio files into Turkish text.
- **Format Conversion (FFmpeg):** Uses FFmpeg to convert different audio formats into the WAV format that Vosk can process.
- **Text Summarization (Gemini):** Summarizes the text generated by Vosk using Google Gemini (1.5 Flash model).
- **Web Interface (React):** Provides a user-friendly interface showing file upload, processing status, and results (transcript and summary).
- **Backend API (Flask):** Offers a Flask API that manages audio processing, Vosk, FFmpeg, and Gemini integrations.

## Technology Stack

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js and npm/yarn:** Required for the frontend. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2.  **Python 3.x:** Required for the backend. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3.  **FFmpeg:** Required for audio file conversion. Must be installed on your system and available in the system's PATH variable. [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
    - To verify the installation, run `ffmpeg -version` in your terminal.
4.  **Git:** Required for version control and GitHub. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

### Steps

1.  **Clone (or download) the Project:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Update this once the repo is created
    cd vtest
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    ```bash
    cd server

    # Create a virtual environment (skip if exists)
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # Windows (PowerShell):
    .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
    # Windows (CMD):
    .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
    # macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Download Vosk Model
    # Download the Turkish model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
    # Place the downloaded model folder (e.g., vosk-model-small-tr-0.3) under the server/model/ directory.
    # Create the server/model/ directory if it doesn't exist.
    # File structure should be: server/model/vosk-model-small-tr-0.3/

    # Set Gemini API Key
    # Create a file named .env in the server/ directory.
    # Add the following line to it (replace with your actual key):
    # GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...YOUR_API_KEY...

    cd .. # Return to the root directory
    ```

    _Note: Linters might show import errors if they don't recognize packages in the virtual environment. These errors should not prevent the code from running when the virtual environment is active._

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install  # or yarn install
    cd .. # Return to the root directory
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    # Make sure the virtual environment is activated
    python app.py
    ```

    The backend will start running at `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    _Open a separate terminal._
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will usually open at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port). Visit this address in your browser.
